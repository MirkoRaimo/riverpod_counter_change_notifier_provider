# riverpod_counter_change_notifier_provider

<b>Riverpod is awesome!</b><p>
  Here you can find an example on how to build the counter app, using just the <b>ChangeNotifier</b> and <b>ChangeNotifierProvider</b>!<br>
Obviously you shouldn't use them to handle just a counter, but I wanted to keep the example as simple as possible! ðŸ˜‰
